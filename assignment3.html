                     My reaction towards 3D printing: <br /> <br />

                        <br />
                        I wanted to make the lamp from Tangled since Tangled is one of my favorite movies and I thought 
                        it would be a fun lamp to make that I would want to display in my room. 
                        <br /> <br />

                        <img src="tangled2.jpg" width=400>
                        
                        <i> Process </i> <br /> <br />
                       I created the sides of the lamp in illustrator. I traced the outline of the sun and the pattern of the lamp
                       in Illustrator. I didn't want the lamp to be too small, but my first iteration was way too square so I made 
                       the panels more of a rectangle shape to better resemble the lamp from Tangled. The panels are 4x6 inches
                        (originally they were 4x4). <br /> <br />
                            <img src="assign3.png" width=400> <br /> <br />
                       Once I got the fun part out of the way, I focused on the connectors. Since I was making a rectangle table lamp,
                        I just wanted to make corner connectors. I made two iterations: (1) 1x1in corner connector and (1) .5x.5in corner connector.
                        I made these shapes by putting together different rectangles and squares in Rhino and trimming the outside boxes to make the
                        shape I wanted. I used the extrude curve function to create the 3D shape and then I exported to Dremal to print.

                        <br /><br />
                        Once I got the connectors printed, I put together the rectangle lamp using the connectors in the corner and the bottom.

<b>Issues</b> <br /> <br />
Problem 1: 
   <br /> 
The printer was having issues clearing out the previous filament and I didn't know how to trouble shoot. Had to change filaments.

<br /> <br />
<b>Final Designs </b> <br /> <br />
I used Illustrator to laser cut the shapes.
