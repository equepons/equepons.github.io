                    <p>
                     My reaction towards 3D printing: <br /> <br />

                        <br />
                        I wanted to make the lamp from Tangled since Tangled is one of my favorite movies and I thought 
                        it would be a fun lamp to make that I would want to display in my room. 
                        <br /> <br />

                        <i> Process </i> <br /> <br />
                       I created the sides of the lamp in illustrator. I traced the outline of the sun and the pattern of the lamp
                       in Illustrator. I didn't want the lamp to be too small, but my first iteration was way too square so I made 
                       the panels more of a rectangle shape to better resemble the lamp from Tangled. The panels are 4x6 inches
                        (originally they were 4x4). <br /> <br />

                       Once I got the fun part out of the way, I focused on the connectors. Since I was making a rectangle table lamp,
                        I just wanted to make corner connectors. I made two iterations: (1) 1x1in corner connector and (1) .5x.5in corner connector.
                        I made these shapes by putting together different rectangles and squares in Rhino and trimming the outside boxes to make the
                        shape I wanted. I used the extrude curve function to create the 3D shape and then I exported to Dremal to print.

                        <br /><br />
                        Once I got the connectors printed, I put together the rectangle lamp using the connectors in the corner and the bottom.

                        
                         
<b>Issues</b> <br /> <br />
<b> Problem 1-3: </b>
   <br /> 
The printer was having issues clearing out the previous filament and I didn't know how to trouble shoot. Had to change filaments. 
<br /> <br />

<br /> <br />
<b> Problem 4: </b>
<br />
Glue dried up from having to heat up the printer so many times that it popped off in the middle of printing
<br /> <br />

<br /> <br />
<b> Problem 5: </b>
<br />
I don't even know what happened
<br /> <br />

<br /> <br />
<b> Problem 6: </b>
<br />
The large connectors (first iteration) completely broke the wood panels. I had to redo the panels on cardboard.

<br /> <br />
<b>Final Design </b> <br /> <br />
My glorious lamp came together and made my tangled dreams come true. I only used the small connectors and did not end up using the larger ones at all. <br /> <br />
