                        My inspiration for this assignment:

                        <i> Process </i> <br /> <br />
                       My coworker has a cellphone holder at her desk in the shape of a dinosaur. I decided to use that as an inspiration
                        to make my mold. I found an STL file of a dinosaur that was very similar to the one my coworker has on her desk and decided
                        to make the mold from it. <br /> <br />

                        <br /> <br />
                        I was going to try my hand at milling the machinable max, however, due to the size I was not able to mill it. 
                        When I went to the Mill to get it cut, they said none of the qualified staff members were around. When I went to Nadya's OH
                        on Sunday, I was not one of the lucky few to get my piece milled with the ShopBot so I looked for alternate routes. I decided to 
                        3D print the piece rather than try to mill it using the Bantam Mill in light of all of the problems I had in the milling assignment. 
        <br /> <br />
                        To create the mold's STL file, I downloaded the file into Rhino and built a box around it. The box is 2x2 inches and I scaled
                        the dino down to fit in the box with some room.

 After the mold was 3D printed, I mixed the oomoo to create the silicone mold. Since I work, I left the mold in the Mill all day and night
        and picked it up before class. <br /> <br />

    To conserve plaster for the rest of the class, Omari, Kira and I gt together to plaster together so we would use too much or too
    little plaster.

<b>Issues</b> <br /> <br />
        <b>Issue 1 </b> Machinable wax was too big and no one at the Mill was around to cut it. <br /> <br />
        <b>Issue 2 </b> During Sunday OH, I was not one of the lucky few to get their wax milled with the shopbot so I decided
to 3D print instead. Since I printed at Fluke, I had no issues 3D printing. <br /> <br />
          
<br /> <br />
<b>Final Design </b> <br /> <br />
My final dinos came put super cute! I'm really happy with how they turned out. <br /> <br />
