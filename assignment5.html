                        After hours and hours of building the box and milling, this is a perfect representation of 
                        me during those trying times.

                        <i> Process </i> <br /> <br />
                       Making a box and using a mill instead of using a laser cutter to cut the pieces seemed pretty straight forward
                        so I wasn't worried about the assignment at first. I started the process by making a rectangle on OnShape, extruding 
                        the shapes and importing them into assembly. It took a few tries to get the dimensions of the end pieces of the box correct
                        but I was able to make it work! After, I loaded the pieces to kicad and then to BantamTools for milling. 
                        Once I had the pieces good to go, I milled shapes into the FR using the 1/32 tip.

<b>Issues</b> <br /> <br />
        <b>Issue 1 </b> The first issue was getting the dimensions correct in onshape, for some reason when I would put the pieces in the assembly they 
        didn't fit too well so it took a few tries to get a shape I was satisfied with. <br /> <br />
        <b>Issue 2 & 3 </b> When I loaded the file into kicad, the shape was stupidly small and I didn't know that this would affect the 
        milling. The shapes came out really small. I had to play around with the scaling on kicad to get the pieces to be converted correctly. Also, the tape wouldn't hold
        and the piece kept flying off. <br /> <br />

<br /> <br />
<b>Final Design </b> <br /> <br />
The box fit a tiny bit loose but still held together so overall, I was pleased with it. <br /> <br />
