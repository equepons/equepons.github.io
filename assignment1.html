                     I started this assignment by looking up different examples of Press Fit Construction Kits,
                      and I got really excited about some of the examples. I was hoping to do something really ambitious
                        like a press construction kit Mickey Mouse, but I realized that I needed to scale down and test things 
                        out first before going head first into something so complex.

                        I ended up drawing random shapes on
                        illustrator to see how I felt about them. I ended up deciding on some square and circle shapes.
