                        <i> Objective </i> <br /> <br />
                      The object of this project was to put together a multi-layer sheetmask/small cosmetic storage box
                      that open and shuts. My goal was to use 3D printing, CAD modeling, stock parts and laser cutting. The inspiration
                      for this project were Kaboodles. <br /> <br />

        Overall, I accomplished my goal and successfully put together my box. <br /> <br />
                        <br /> <br />
        <b>Final Project</b> <br /> <br />
        My project consists of two boxes laser cut out of acrylic and pressed fit together. The boxes are stacked one on top of the other
        and are connected by linkages. You slide open the top box to access the second box. The top box has a lid that snaps into place. <br /> <br />

            <i>Reasoning Behind Box Design </i> <br />
                For the top box to serve as the bottom box's lid, I wanted a flat edge box. The top box would also need to have a
            flat edge and have to be open so I can put items into it. Since I've only ever designed closed boxes, I used a <a href="https://boxdesigner.connectionlab.org/">box generator</a> to get an idea of
how to make this box and then proceeded to make the vector box design on Illustrator. <br /> <br />
            
            <i> Reasoning Behind Box Movement </i> <br />
            To replicate how traditional makeup boxes move, the movement had to go as an arc to go up and then slide back. <br /> <br />
            
             <b>Process</b> <br /> <br />
            1. <i>Illustrator vector box: </i> I created one large rectangle to be the bottom of the box. The width and height of the rectangle
            determined the size I wanted to box to be. I created 2 different sets of rectangles (male and female) to make the edges
            the edges of the box. The female pieces are equal to the width of the bottom rectangle and the height is how tall I wanted the box. 
            The male pieces are equal to the height of the bottom rectangle and the height match the height of the female pieces <br />
            <i>Final measurements:</i> Bottom rectangle: 6 inches x 5 inches. Female pieces: 6 in x 1.5 inches. Male pieces: 5 inches by 1.5 inches. 
            <br /> <br />
            
            2. <i> Creating the teeth and slots of the box: </i> To make a flat edge box, the female pieces need to have corners that create an angle
            so the edges of the boxes are flush with the male pieces. The height of the slot is equal to the thickness of the material. I used
            acrylic for this project, the acrylic is 1/8 of an inch in thickness. From past projects, I knew that the more slots the female
            part has the more stable the box is. <br /> I decided to create 2 boxes on the height of the female parts first. To keep the top and the bottom
            corners, I created 2 boxes that intersected with the rectangle by 1/8th of an inch and played around with the width of the box
            until I spread them out evenly. After I had the measurement of the width of the box, I added 8 boxes that fit evenly on the bottom edge and used the
            Horizontal Distribute Space tool in Illustrator to distrubute the objects more precisecly to the distance I needed. I repeated this process on the 
            male parts but I removed the flush edge. <br /> For the bottom piece, I distributed the boxes to match the distrubution of
            the bottom of the female and male parts. Once all of the boxes were created, I used the Path Creator Tool (Minus Front) to finalize
            the shapes. <br /> I created two sets of these pieces. <br /> <b> Total Pieces: 8; Female Part Slot Dimensions: 1/8 inch deep, .3 inch wide; Male Part Teeth: 1/8 inch in height, .3 inch wide. </b>
          <br /> <br />
            
            3. <i> Creating holes for rivets: </i> To create the holes for the rivets, I used calibers to get the width of the rivet and set 2 holes 
            to that width. I made sure the two holes were aligned to each other about an inch away from each other.
