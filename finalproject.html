                        <i> Objective </i> <br /> <br />
                      The object of this project was to put together a multi-layer sheetmask/small cosmetic storage box
                      that open and shuts. My goal was to use 3D printing, CAD modeling, stock parts and laser cutting. The inspiration
                      for this project were Kaboodles. <br /> <br />

        Overall, I accomplished my goal and successfully put together my box. <br /> <br />
                        <br /> <br />
        <b>Final Project</b> <br /> <br />
        My project consists of two boxes laser cut out of acrylic and pressed fit together. The boxes are stacked one on top of the other
        and are connected by linkages. You slide open the top box to access the second box. The top box has a lid that snaps into place. <br /> <br />

            <i>Reasoning Behind Box Design </i> <br />
                For the top box to serve as the bottom box's lid, I wanted a flat edge box. The top box would also need to have a
            flat edge and have to be open so I can put items into it. Since I've only ever designed closed boxes, I used a <a href="https://boxdesigner.connectionlab.org/">box generator</a> to get an idea of
how to make this box and then proceeded to make the vector box design on Illustrator. <br /> <br />
            
            <i> Reasoning Behind Box Movement </i> <br />
            To replicate how traditional makeup boxes move, the movement had to go as an arc to go up and then slide back. <br /> <br />
            
             <b>Process</b> <br /> <br />
            1. <i>Illustrator Vector Box: </i> Create one large rectangle to be the bottom of the box. The width and height of the rectangle
            should be the size you want the box to be. Create 2 different sets of boxes to make the edges
            rectangles to make up the edges of the box. The longer edges should be equal to the width of the bottom rectangle and the height should be how tall you want the box. 
            The shorter edges should be equal to the height of the bottom rectangle and the height should be how tall you want the box. <br />
            <i>Final measurements:</i> Bottom rectangle: 6 inches x 5 inches. Long edges: 6 in x 1.5 inches. Short edges: 5 inches by 1.5 inches.
