                        <i> Objective </i> <br /> <br />
                      The object of this project was to put together a multi-layer sheetmask/small cosmetic storage box
                      that open and shuts. My goal was to use 3D printing, CAD modeling, stock parts and laser cutting. The inspiration
                      for this project were Kaboodles. Overall, I accomplished my goal and successfully put together my box. <br /> <br />

                        To create the mold's STL file, I downloaded the file into Rhino and built a box around it. The box is 2x2 inches and I scaled
                        the dino down to fit in the box with some room.

 After the mold was 3D printed, I mixed the oomoo to create the silicone mold. Since I work, I left the mold in the Mill all day and night
        and picked it up before class. <br /> <br />

    To conserve plaster for the rest of the class, Omari, Kira and I gt together to plaster together so we would use too much or too
    little plaster.

<b>Issues</b> <br /> <br />
        <b>Issue 1 </b> Machinable wax was too big and no one at the Mill was around to cut it. <br /> <br />
        <b>Issue 2 </b> During Sunday OH, I was not one of the lucky few to get their wax milled with the shopbot so I decided
to 3D print instead. Since I printed at Fluke, I had no issues 3D printing. <br /> <br />

<b>Final Design </b> <br /> <br />
My final dinos came put super cute! I'm really happy with how they turned out. <br /> <br />
