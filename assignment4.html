                        For this assignment, I just wanted to make something sucessfully move smoothly without getting
                        too complicated. When I was younger, I remember an elementary school teacher using a mood indicator to 
                        help understand how the class was feeling. I decided to make one.
                        <br /> <br />

                        <i> Process </i> <br /> <br />
                       I had such a hard time 3D printing, I really did not want to 3D print again so I decided to laser cut
        cardboard to keep the cost of everything low. I also modified the mood indicator a bit by making including a second short hand. 
        I decided to add a second hand just to practive OnShape and also, I figured one hand could be used to indicate how I'm feeling
        and the other one how I would want to feel. I started the shapes by using the rectangle tool and then used the line tool to make
        the arrow head. Once I had the shape I wanted, I extruded the arrow to the width of the cardboard (0.1 inches). The bigger
        arrow is 5 inches and the smaller one is 4 inches in length. After I got the sizing down, I worked on the hole for the rivets. 
        Since the arrows would be at the base of the rivet, I set the whole to .180 inches. For the flat piece the indicator would be on,
        I set the hole to .20 inches since that part of the rivet is thicker. I created an assembly in OnShape using all three pieces in order to test it. 
        I used a laser cutter to cut the two arrows and the base.

<b>Issues</b> <br /> <br />
I honestly didn't have too many issues this time around, which was a relief after last week. I owe it to Kira and Omari for teaching me
OnShape. I think the biggest
issue was the waiting time, there were a lot of people in the Mill using the laser cutters so it took me a couple
of hours for me to be able to cut my three pieces. 

<br /> <br />
<b>Final Design </b> <br /> <br />
Once I had everything laser cutted, I put it together and added moods with a sharpie!

Omari and Kira walked me through how to make my shapes efficiently on OnShape!
